    <h1 id="faelle">Cases</h1>

    <p>The following document examines the fundamental rights violation by the german gun law.
        It distinguishes between three cases that take place at
        different points in the examination scheme but in any case fail in favor of the applicant.</p>

        <h2 id="falla">Case A</h2>

    <p>Security is a human right, derived from human dignity and the European or general human rights
        convention.</p>

    <h2 id="fallb">Case B</h2>

    <p>Security is a legal right, but not derived from human dignity and human rights.

    <p>The <a href="quellen/beschluss_einstweilige_anordnung_ocr.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">decision</a>
    of 27.02.2019 on the plaintiff's injunction concerns the <b>constitutionally</b> protected
    security <b>interest</b> of the population.
<blockquote>
    The requirements standardized in the Arms Act are indispensable and serve, in particular, to ensure the
    constitutionally protected security interests of the population to which the applicant himself refers
    in another, legally incorrect context
</blockquote>

    <h3>Questions to the court</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>In which article of the constitution is public safety and order defined and protected as interest of
            the population?</li>
    <li>What is an interest and is it a legal protected right?</li>
    <li>What is a concern and is it a legal protected right?</li>
    <li>What is the difference between legal protected rights, interests and concerns?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="fallc">Case C</h2>

    <p>Security is not a legal right itself, but the protection of central legal rights such as the right to life.
</p>
    <p>The wording of the gun law</p>

    <blockquote>ยง 1 (1) This law regulates the handling of guns or ammunition taking into account the interests of public
    safety and order</blockquote>

    <p>and the <a href="quellen/beschluss_einstweilige_anordnung_ocr.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">decision</a>
        of 02.27.2019 on the injunction of the plaintiff does not show that security is a legal
        right, but only a concern or interest.
</p>
    <p>The verdict of the BVerfG 69, 315 - Brokdorf defines security as the <b>protection of the central legal
        rights</b> to life, health, property, etc.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Accordingly, the term "public safety" covers the <b>protection of essential legal rights</b> such as life,
        health, freedom, honor, property and property of the individual, and the integrity of the legal system and
            public institutions, assuming, as a general rule, a <b>threat</b> to public security
            <b>if a punishable violation of
                these protected rights threatens</b>. "Public order" refers to the totality of the unwritten rules,
            the observance
        of which, according to prevailing social and ethical views, is regarded as an indispensable prerequisite for
        an orderly human coexistence within a certain area.
    </p>
    <p>However, these definitions alone do not guarantee a constitutional application of the law. Significant
        for the constitutional assessment are two limitations, which are laid down in the law itself and which mean
        that prohibitions and dissolutions can essentially be considered only for the protection of basic legal
        rights, while a mere threat to public order in general will not suffice.

    <h1 id="eroeffnung">The protection scope</h1>

    <h2 id="persl">Personal protection scope</h2>

    <p>Cases A and B: The applicant has the fundamental right to security.</p>

    <p>Case C: The plaintiff has the right to general freedom of action under GG Art. 2 para. 1</p>

    <h2 id="sachl">Functional protection</h2>

    <p>Case A: The right to security is protected by the constitution in conjunction with human rights. The law assures
        the plaintiff that he should be able to ward off an attack on his physical integrity <b>without</b> restriction of
    the means.</p>

    <p>Case B: The right to security is protected by the constitution. The law assures the plaintiff that he should
        be able to ward off an attack on his physical integrity <b>with</b> restrictions of the means.</p>

    <p>Case C: Article 2 (1) assures the plaintiff of the general freedom of action as
        long as the rights of others are not affected.</p>

    <h1 id="eingriff">Interference with the protected scope</h1>

    <p>Case A and B: The Arms Act restricts self-defense by excluding defenses. The firearm is the only meaningful
    and decent means of self-defense. The equipment of the police proves that a milder means of defense against
    dangers is not possible, otherwise this remedy would be used by the police.</p>

    <p>Case C: The gun law limits the general freedom of action.</p>

    <h1 id="schranke">Constitutional justification for the intervention (= barrier)</h1>

    <h2 id="einfach">Fundamental rights with simple legal reservation</h2>

    <p>Case A, B and C: There is no simple reservation of law.</p>

    <h2 id="quali">Fundamental rights with qualified legal reservation</h2>

    <p>Case A and B: There is no qualified legal reserve.</p>

    <p>Case C: Reservation in the constitution, Art. 2 (1)</p>

    <p>Everyone has the right to the free development of his personality, as far as he does not violate
        the rights of others and does not violate the constitutional order or moral law.</p>

    <p>But against what other right,
        <a href="http://www.servat.unibe.ch/dfr/bv006032.html"
           target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">constitutional order</a> (set of norms) or moral law is violated,
    if a firearm is possessed, borne and used for self-defense?</p>

    <h2 id="immanent">Constitutional barriers</h2>

    <p>Case A: There are no barriers, on the contrary, human rights are inviolable and inalienable.</p>

    <p>Case B: A restriction of the means of defense would be constitutional, if the protection of the life would
    collide with another legal right. The gun law tries to protect the same legal right (right to life, physical
        integrity).</p>

    <p>If one right of a human collides with the same right of another human being, it is not possible to weigh it
    up but to count it. According to the object formula, man must not be degraded to a countable item of
        governmental actions,
    as this violates his human dignity. The state states with the gun law that the security of the majority
    is more important than the security of the individual, that is a counting. The purpose of
    public safety - the security of the majority - becomes with (the means) the expropriation of
    the individual security he buys.
        The safety of others should be improved by renouncing one's own safety. The law
        requires a self-sacrificing selflessness of the individual. Because the others can own
        legal but illegally applicable guns and even illegal guns, the intention is unattainable.</p>

    <p>Case C: There is no specific conflicting legal interests, since security itself is not a legal interest, but merely
    the protection of a central legal interest. However, the protection of a legal property justifies a concrete
        intervention in a concrete legal good of general freedom of action <b>only if</b> that legal property is
        <b>immediately</b> endangered. If mere possession of guns would directly endanger public safety,
        <b>there would be no exceptions</b> for firearms ownership.</p>

    <blockquote>b) A constitutional review in constitutional interpretation is also subject to the provision of ยง 15 VersG,
    according to which the competent authority may make the assembly dependent on certain conditions or prohibit
        or dissolve "<b>if</b>, according to the circumstances recognizable at the time of the order, <b>public security or
            order is immediately jeopardized</b> when performing the demonstration".

    <h1 id="schranken-schranken">Limits of limits</h1>

    <h2 id="formell">Formal constitutionality of the restrictive law. Competence, procedure, form</h2>

    <p>The representation of the people must be elected in the provinces according to GG Art. 28 para. 1
    and in the Federation pursuant to GG Art. 38 para. 1 in general, direct, free, equal and secret ballot.
        The deputies should be subject only to their conscience.</p>

    <h3 id="wahlfreiheit">Free elections</h3>

    <p>The elections were not free at the latest since the introduction of the <b>list candidates</b>, since the
        preselection of the candidates by an <b>intermediate instance</b> (parties) comes about.</p>

    <p>There are also unfree and indirectly elected MPs in the Bundestag.</p>

    <blockquote>The freedom of elections consists first of all in the fact that every voter can freely exercise his right
        to vote, ie <b>without coercion or other inadmissible influence from outside</b>.
        The right should protect the
    free election. Whether, moreover, freedom of elections demands even more today can be left open here.
    For at any rate, the concept of freedom of elections can not be used to derive any principles for the technical
    design of the exercise of the electoral law. The principle of free elections is therefore not affected by the
        introduction of <b>rigid lists</b>. It is not a question of more or less free election activity, but whether a
    proportional choice associated with elements of the majority vote is carried out with free or bound lists,
        but a question of the <b>more detailed design</b> of the electoral exercise.
        (<a href="http://www.servat.unibe.ch/dfr/bv007063.html#Rn019" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
            BVerfGE 7, 63 Rn 19 - Listenwahl</a>)</blockquote>

    <p>The judges of the constitutional court have never had to make holiday on Lake Balaton, these holiday destinations
        were on Honecker's <b>rigid lists</b> of allowed vacation destinations of the GDR citizens and could
        be selected without
        <b>coercion and other inadmissible influence from the outside</b> by the citizens of the GDR. The holiday on the
    knee-flat Lake Balaton was also safer than in the shallows of Ballermann.</p>

    <p>For the court, the candidate lists are only a technical design of the elections. That being preselected
        onto the candidate list affects
    the loyalty of the deputies to the party, misunderstands or obscures the court.</p>

    <p>The proof of the lack of freedom of the elections and the associated loyalty of the deputies to the
        party are secret votings <b>in</b> the Bundestag, eg election of the Chancellor.
        Secret votings in the Bundestag
    should protect or strengthen the free conscience of the deputies before the pressure of the party. The GG demands,
        however, that the deputies should <b>always</b> be subject to their conscience and always to 100%.
        So if the elections
        <b>to</b> the Bundestag are free and do not manifest the loyalty of the deputies to the party,
        what is the reason for
    the secret votings in the Bundestag?</p>

    <h3 id="ausgestaltung">Technical design of the elections</h3>

    <p>Will the Bundeswehr, as the technical design of national defense, be given into the hands of a
    potential enemy?</p>

    <p>Even a technical design belongs in the hands of the sovereign and not in the hands of the potential
    enemy. The preselection of the deputy candidates in the form of the candidates lists belongs to the hand
    of the sovereign.</p>

    <h3 id="unmittelbarkeit">Immediacy</h3>

    <p>The immediacy of the election is violated by list voting. The directness required by the constitution
    is violated. GG Art. 38 does not allow any exceptions that not directly elected representatives in the
    Bundestag act.</p>

    <blockquote>The principle of immediacy, as was already recognized under the Weimar Constitution, can not be
    restricted, even in its wording, to prohibiting only indirect election by electors. It also
        <b>excludes</b> any electoral procedure in which, between voters and electoral candidates, an <b>electoral
            body</b> joins the electoral process <b>after the electoral process and, at its discretion, elects the
    deputies</b>, thereby depriving the individual electorate of the power of self-determination of the
    future deputies by voting.
        <a href="http://www.servat.unibe.ch/dfr/bv007063.html#Rn016" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
            (BVerfGE 7, 63 Rn 16 - Listenwahl)
        </a>
    </blockquote>

    <p>The idea of โโelectors, as in the US electoral system, is therefore not the sole reason for the electoral
    directness.</p>

    <p>There can not be an instance which, at its discretion, selects the deputies.</p>

    <p>The court ignores or disguises that the election can be manipulated both <b>before</b> and <b>after</b>
        the election.</p>

    <p>There follows the proof that manipulating the election by lists <b>before</b> the election is <b>more harmful</b>
    than post-election manipulation.</p>

    <p>Given 4 candidates: Hitler, Stalin, Jesus and Mother Theresa.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Manipulation before the election: Only Hitler and Stalin are put on the list, the people vote.
        </li>
        <li>
            Manipulation after the election: The people vote. Most of the votes are given to Jesus and Mother
            Theresa. Jesus and Mother Theresa, as electors, vote for deputies.
        </li>
    </ul>


    <p>
        Does te court still believe that a manipulation before the election is only a technical
        design of the elections?
    </p>

    <p>The verdict bears witness to the self-importance and presumed superiority of the German
    electoral system and German morality, and to the intelligence of the judges, of a cynicism of
    monstrous proportions.</p>

    <p>The fact is that an instance (parties) intervenes before the elections and restricts the
    elections and manipulates it.</p>

    <h3 id="folgen">Consequences of the non-free and indirect elections for the gun law</h3>

    <p>According to GG Art. 77 (1), federal laws are passed by the Bundestag. The Bundestag is
    elected in accordance with GG Art. 38 para. 1 in a free and direct election. From the fact that such a election
    has not taken place since the rigid list was chosen, it follows that no legitimate Bundestag exists (has) and it
    follows that the participants present in the vote of the gun law lacked the formal decision-making competence.</p>

    <h2 id="materiell">Material constitutionality of the restrictive law</h2>

    <h3 id="wesen">Essential nature guarantee (article 19 II GG)</h3>

    <p>Case A: not applicable, not restrictable at all.</p>

    <p>Case B: Infringement, as the success of defending his physical integrity is left to a random principle.
    For a person who is not classified as endangered, it is absolutely forbidden under the gun law to defend
    himself with a firearm, as it may not be used. A self-defense capability is not given if it is clear from the
    outset that the defense depends on chance and probably ineffective. The defense is ineffective if too a weak
    defense tool is chosen. To determine which means is just enough, the future must be predictable. Therefore, only
    the attitude is admissible that only one firearm is sufficient for the defense.</p>

    <p>Case C: not constitutional, as no legal interest.</p>

    <h3 id="einzelfall">Prohibition of burdensome individual case law (Art. 19 I 1 GG)</h3>

    <p>OK</p>

    <h3 id="zitierg">Quotation (Article 19 I 2 GG)</h3>

    <p>Case A, B and C: The gun law violates the quotation principle.</p>

    <h3 id="bestimmtheit">Principle of certainty</h3>

    <p>The protection of public order does not ensure constitutional application of the law.</p>

    <p>The protection of public security does not ensure constitutional application of the law.</p>

    <blockquote>However, these definitions alone do not guarantee a constitutional application of the law. Significant
    for the constitutional assessment are two limitations, which are laid down in the law itself and which
    mean that prohibitions and dissolutions can essentially be considered only for the protection of basic

    </blockquote>

    <p>The scale of protection and the value (on the scale) of the protection is not defined. Only measures
    consisting of the individual paragraphs of the law are defined in order to reach an undefined value on an
    undefined scale. Of course, the value of the supposedly poor initial state and the desired state is missing.</p>

    <p>Gun law ยง 8 pushes indeterminacy to the extreme. There are "particularly recognizable personal interests"
    were sufficient for the proof of a need.</p>

    <p>Gun law ยง 19, To lead firearms, someone must be "more at risk than the general public by attacks on
    life or limb".</p>

    <p>ยง 14, "[...] Within six months as a rule no more than two firearms may be acquired."</p>

    <p>Here the condition or requirement for the deviation from the rule is missing.</p>

    <h3 id="parlamentsvorbehalt">Parliamentary reservation (essentiality theory)</h3>

    <p>Significant decisions must be taken by the legislature and not left to the administration. The
    essential question to what extent a person is endangered (ยง 19), in order to obtain a firearm license,
    decides the administration without defaults of the legislator. About the need (ยง 8) also decides the
    administration according to discretion.</p>

    <p>If the law concerns the central legal interests, the requirements for the materiality of the law are higher.</p>

    <blockquote>Today, it is settled case-law that the legislature is obliged - in isolation from the characteristic
    of "interference" - in fundamental normative areas, especially in the area of โโthe exercise of fundamental
    rights, insofar as this state regulation is accessible, to make all significant
    decisions <a href="http://www.servat.unibe.ch/dfr/bv049089.html#Rn076" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">

    </blockquote>

    <h3 id="uebermass">Proportionality principle in the form of excess prohibition</h3>

    <h4 id="zweck">Constitutional purpose</h4>

    <p>The aim of the gun law is <b>feigned</b> with the mention of the term "purpose" in ยง 1.</p>

    <p>The gun law "regulates the handling of guns or ammunition" . The gun law therefore regulates an
    action and does not pursue a purpose in this phrase.</p>

    <p>It also says: "taking into account the concerns of public safety and order." Here, no purpose is
    mentioned, but a concern that should only be considered.</p>

    <p>A proof for the concealment tactics of the legislator in the objective are various laws with defined
    purposes. Wherever a suitable tool exists and the constitutionality can not be doubted, the legislature also
    formulates a clear aim of the law. Where it is impossible to reach a purpose and where there is no suitable means
    to reach the purpose, or where the purpose may not be given to the people, no purpose is mentioned.</p>

    <h5>Laws with a defined purpose</h5>

    The above laws protect safety. The pattern recognition of a 5-year-old would conclude that
        the purpose of the gun law should be as follows:
</p>
    <p>
    The purpose of this law is to protect the lives of people from criminals with firearms.
</p>
    <p>
        In contrast, the gun law <b>regulates the handling</b> of guns <b>in consideration</b> of security.
</p>
    <p>
    In which direction and for which interest groups is security regulated?
</p>
    <p>
    Dividing the groups into the public, the individual and the state apparatus reveals the unconstitutionality
        because the individual is the least protected.
</p>
    <p>
    The imaginative creation of the decision on the constitutional complaint of a shooting sports
        association gets a bad taste, if one is aware of the nature of the legal <b>dis</b>order, see
        <a href="#formelle_verfassungsmaessigkeit">Formal
            constitutionality of the restrictive law</a>.
</p>
    <blockquote>
        The use of guns primarily serves <b>to protect the legal system</b>, for the defense of which by force
        of arms the state has a monopoly. (<a href="https://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/entscheidungen/rk20030401_1bvr053903#abs14"

<p>
    Thus the BVerfG exposes the true purpose of the law as <b>protection of the state apparatus and its
    injustice order from its own people and sovereign</b>.
</p>
    <p>
        <b>The authors of the gun law have spent effort to disguise the purpose of the law.</b>
</p>
    <p>
    Questions to the court:
</p>

   <ul>
        <li>
             What is the purpose of the gun law?
    </li>
        <li>
            Who should protect whom by what means against which dangers?
   </li>
        <li>
             If the handling of guns should be the desirable result (purpose), what are the actions?
    </li>
        <li>
            And why "does" the law "regulate" the purpose / purpose itself and not the actions that
            lead to the goal?
    </li>
        <li>
            If safety is to be the purpose, why should it ONLY be considered and why has not it
            been directly defined as a purpose?
</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    In the case that security is the purpose of the law:
</p>
    <p>Case A,B and C: The gun law does not define a constitutional purpose. The legal interests themselves are worth protecting,
    but not the protection of legal interests. With the laws (StGb etc.) alone, which protect the life, health,
        property etc. the duty of the state for the protection of the legal interests is <b>exhausted</b>.
        The justification
        for further interventions requires an <b>immediate</b> threat to the central legal interests.</p>

    <h4>Suitability of the (constitutional) means</h4>

    <p>Case A, B and C: If seconds decide, the police are minutes away. The protection of the central legal interests will
    be reduced contrary to the objective if the victim is deprived of the means of protection. The means of
    criminals, however, can not be restricted by law. The potential criminal has the opportunity
    to get guns in a legal or illegal way.</p>

    <h4>Necessity of the means</h4>

    <p>Case A, B and C: A milder and more effective way to increase security is to arm citizens. It is milder
    because no rights are restricted and more effective because protection is guaranteed with the least possible delay.</p>

    <h4>Adequacy of the means / proportionality ie S. / Proportionality</h4>

    <p>Case A, B and C: The greatest possible realization of fundamental rights is achieved with the abolition of the
    self-defense and emergency aid prohibition, ie the gun law. Every citizen will have more freedom of action
    and will have the opportunity to take care of their own safety.</p>
